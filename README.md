## Hi there 👋

I’m Rémi, a passionate language learner (fluent in Japanese, Chinese, and Korean) and aspiring full-stack web developer.

I am currently training as a Web Developer at O’clock, where I design and build modern web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, Svelte, React, and Node.js.

I focus on creating accessible, structured, and dynamic projects, applying best practices in both front-end and back-end development.

Check out my repositories to explore my work, and feel free to reach out if you’d like to collaborate or discuss web development projects.
